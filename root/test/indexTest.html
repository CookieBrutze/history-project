        <h2>About This Site</h2>
        <p>This is a simple, text-based website designed to showcase how a clean and modern stylesheet can enhance readability. The site is divided into multiple sections with different background colors for easy navigation.</p>
        <p>The header stays sticky at the top, while the footer remains at the bottom of the page.</p>
        <p>Feel free to click <a href="#">this link</a> to see how links look with the styling.</p>

        <h2>Why Simple Design Matters</h2>
        <p>A minimalist design helps reduce distractions and focuses the reader's attention on the content. Consistent use of spacing, colors, and font sizes can make a huge difference in how comfortable it is to read a page.</p>
        <p>This second section is styled slightly differently, with a new background color and header style to differentiate it from the first one.</p>
